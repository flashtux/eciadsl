To compile the C code, you need to install sdcc, which is available
from http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/

Installation:
-------------

From the firmware directory, execute the 2 commandes and wait for a
very long term based.

( cd src ; make )
( cd tools ; make )

Using:
------

In src, you'll find a test firmware (a replacement firmware is not yet
operationnal), compile it:

$ cd src
$ make

Next, you need a tool to load and read the EZUSB memory (external RAM
from the point of view of the 8051) :

$ cd tools
$ make

To load the firmware (VID and PID used here are for the originial ECI
ADSL modem):

# tools/ezusb-mem w 0x0547 0x2131 ihx/firm_test.ihx

To see if the firmware has been correctly executed, you can read the
whole EZUSB memory with:

# tools/ezusb-meme r 0x0547 0x2131 ihx/mem.ihx

If the execution has been OK, you'll find a line beginning with:

...
:10100000FADADEDA721C0852BEFFF3BBA2001282CB
:10101000DADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADA30
:10102000DADADADADADADADADADADADADADADADA20
...
