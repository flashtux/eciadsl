1. How it works
---------------

Eci modem connection process can be divided into 3 steps:

Step 1: Upload of firmware
Step 2: Synchronization of the dsl Line
Step 3: ppp connection

In our driver, the script ./startmodem performs those steps with commands:
eci-load1 firmware.bin (step 1) This is for firmware uploading
eci-load2 synch01.bin  (step 2) This is for Line Synchronisation
pppd call adsl         (step 3) Initialisation of Point To Point TCP/IP Connection


2. Troubles
-----------

The default file "synch01.bin" is a generic file for having the line
synchronized.
It works fine for a lot of users, but not all the time.

People from other countries may have the same problems.

The solution is to dump all the USB traffic during the Modem initialisation
under Windows, generate a log and use this log to create your own sync file.


3. Let's do it
--------------

Boot under windows.

Download the sniffer from Benoit's website:
http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop/index.en.php3

Disable windows's auto-connection, because we're only interested in the Firmware
synchronization USB packets.

Unplug every other usb devices ... keep only the modem connected.

Start the sniffer.
Install the filters for the modem so as to capture packets from ADSL Connection.
Reboot.

NB: all the sniffed packets are logged in c:\WINxxx\usbsnoop.log

As soon as both red and green leds are fixed, uninstall filter's filters.
At this step, firmware is loaded and synchronisation is OK.
That's the reason we don't need the sniffer anymore.
The file should have grown up to about 10 Mb.


Reboot under linux.
Mount windows partition volume containing the usbsnoop log file so as to copy
it where you want.
Start the script eci_vendor.pl usbsnoop.log
(script eci_vendor.pl is provided with usermode package)

The script parses the log file and generate a new eci_vendor.bin file.

- Driver's version <= 0.5 :
    type mv /etc/eciadsl/eci_wan3.bin /etc/eciadsl/eci_wan3.bin.old
    and then mv eci_vendor.bin /etc/eciadsl/eci_wan3.bin
- Driver's version CVS or >= 0.6 :
    type mv eci_vendor.bin /etc/eciadsl/my_synch.bin
    and then run eciconftxt.sh to use this .bin

Run startmodem...
...and cross your fingers :)
