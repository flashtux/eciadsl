WARNING:
the former names are DEPRECATED, because they are not friendly since they do NOT
indicate AT ALL the place in where the .bin should work.
For instance: do not try eci_lens.bin because you leave near Lens (France).
This .bin has been generated in Lens, but it should work for some people in
Tchapamawak, and may not work for people leaving in Petaouchnok.
Of course if you live in Lens, try synch05.bin first, this is obvious (except
if DSLAM has changed eheh).

If you've generated your own .bin file, please send it us with a few information
regarding to the location/provider

Installation :
- driver version <= 0.5: replace each occurrence of "/etc/eciadsl/eci_wan3.bin" with the
  .bin filename you use in the startmodem script
- driver version > 0.5 : install all the .bin files in the eciadsl/ directory (default
  location is /etc/eciadsl). Launch eciconftxt.sh or eciconf.sh then follow the
  interactive instructions.
