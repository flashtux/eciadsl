PLEASE PLEASE: READ THE WARNING BELOW BEFORE READING THE REST OF THE DOCUMENT!














































******  <<< WARNING: >>>  *****************************************************
**
**  The former names are DEPRECATED, because they are not friendly since they
**  do NOT indicate AT ALL the place in where the .bin should work.
**  For instance: do not try eci_lens.bin because you leave near Lens (France).
**  This .bin has been generated in Lens, but it should work for some people in
**  Tchapamawak, and may not work for people leaving in Petaouchnok.
**  Of course if you live in Lens, try synch05.bin first, this is obvious
**  (except if DSLAM has changed eheh).
**
**  I repeat: this means that a .bin generated in a place X may work in another
**  place Y, and also may not always work in the place X where it has been
**  generated. So don't complain 'cause you don't find a .bin that was
**  generated where you are. TRY ALL .bin's!
