# GPL licensed code, if you don't agree, don't use it.
#
# This script has been written because sometimes, after heavy usage of cpu,
# pppd and pppoeci may be running, but connection down.
# It may happens if you compile too many things, or burn cd with DMA off.
#
# This script checks if drivers are running, connection is up,
# and restart eciadsl if needed.
#
# NO WARRANTIES PROVIDED USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
#
#
# USAGE: chmod +x eciadsl-testconnection
# and add to your root crontab. Runtime period: every 4-5 minutes, or much if
# connection is stable
#
# EXAMPLE:
# */5 * * * * /path/to/eciadsl-testconnection
