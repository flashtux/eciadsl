FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND SOME COMMON TROUBLES
===================================================


Q:	I don't know if my modem is supported:

A:	See the pre-requisites.

	Check here: http://eciadsl.flashtux.org/modems.php.
	
	Launch eciconf or eci-doctor, if they report errors, try to launch
	probe_device.sh	to check your modem compatibility.


Q:	startmodem, or eciconf report me an unsupported modem!

A:	See the previous question.


Q:	startmodem or eciconf output shows: /proc/bus/usb: No such file or directory

A:	Check your system's USB configuration. This may be due to a lack of
	devusbfs support in kernel configuration. If kernel has support for it,
	try to mount it using:
		mount -t usbdevfs none /proc/bus/usb
	This can be set in your /etc/fstab for automounting at boot time.


Q:	eciconf reports me that the DABUSB module is loaded!
	TODO: dabusb leads to which problems?

A:	Disable/remove the dabusb module:
		rm -f /lib/modules/<kernel version>/kernel/drivers/usb/dabusb.o
	Then
		depmod.a
	If this kernel has been compiled by hand, don't forget to remove dabusb
	support from the kernel configuration too.


Q:	eciconf reports me:
	HDLC support is buggy, you should apply the HDLC patch to your kernel source.
	and/or I see this in /var/log/messages:
		sent [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 <asyncmap 0x0> <magic 0xf990655f>]
		..
		LCP: timeout sending Config-Requests
		Connection terminated.

A:	Follow the pre-requisites, read the documentation about then N_HDLC problem.

	If you want to use the 'persist' option of pppd to reconnect automatically
	when disconnected, then you will have to patch your kernel or use a kernel
	>= 2.4.18-pre3. You can find the patch n_hdlc.c.diff in the drivers' archive
	of the Speedtouch modem : http://speedtouch.sourceforge.net/.
	These are the instruction of how to use it:
		cd /usr/src/linux
		patch -p1 --dry-run < /path/to/n_hdlc.c.diff

	If no error message is returned by the patch command, type the following
	lines to make the source's patch:
		patch -p1 < /path/to/n_hdlc.c.diff
	then jump to the kernel configuration question (below).


Q:	My kernel is OK (N_HDLC patched or kernel >=2.4.18-pre3) but I still get
	I get LCP timeout lines in /var/log/messages then a modem hangup
	(and eventually another problem more between both) like this:
		sent [LCP ConfReq id=0x1 <asyncmap 0x0> <magic 0xf990655f>]
		..
		LCP: timeout sending Config-Requests

A:	If your kernel really OK? Check above!

	Check your kernel/pppd version.

	See next question also, because CHAP/PAP authentication problems are not
	always verbosely shown.

	See also below questions related to international users.


Q:	/var/log/messages shows CHAP or PAP failures.

A:	Check for bad PAP/CHAP authentication report in /var/log/messages.
	If so, check your /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
	or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets files. Entries must be like this:
		"username" * "userpassword" *
	Try to configure these using eciconf.


Q:	startmodem stucks at block xxx

A:	Follow the pre-requisites.

	Upgrade your eciadsl driver version (0.5 owners: get the latest CVS)

	Try other synch .bin.


Q:	startmodem went OK, but I still cannot use Internet access?

A:	See previous question.

	If you can ping an IP but cannot ping a hostname, check at your
	/etc/resolv.conf file, it must include your provider's DNS IP.
	For instance (french wanadoo ones):
		nameserver 193.252.19.3
		nameserver 193.252.19.4

	If you still cannot access a hostname using nslookup, try this and
	report us the output:
	- route -n or netstat -rn

	  Kernel IP routing table
	  Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
	  80.14.50.1      0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH       40 0          0 ppp0
	* 10.0.0.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U        40 0          0 eth0
	* 127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U        40 0          0 lo
	  0.0.0.0         80.14.50.1      0.0.0.0         UG       40 0          0 ppp0

	  The lines with a leading * are optional, your eth local network should
	  differ from 10.0.0.0 if you have one.
	  The UG line must appear, this indicate the default route to the gateway.

	- ifconfig ppp0

	  ppp0    Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol  
       		  inet addr:80.14.50.227  P-t-P:80.14.50.1  Mask:255.255.255.255
       		  UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
       		  RX packets:80951 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
       		  TX packets:85395 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
       	  	collisions:0 txqueuelen:3 

	  IPs and some other values will be different from the ones above.

	If ppp0 interface is not up, check for error lines in
	/var/log/messages or /var/log/ppp.

	If the default route (UG) is set to eth0, remove it:
		route del default -net eth0

	If the default route is NOT set to ppp0 even if ppp0 is up:
		route add default dev ppp0


Q:	Sometimes I see some LCP timeouts in /var/log/messages, but my connection
	is still up or it doesn't disconnect every time.

A:	Try to uncomment the two lines that deal with LCP in /etc/ppp/peers/adsl,
	or to slightly increase the values if uncommented.

	This may be due to your provider too, wait a few minutes/hours if you still
	can connect, and if this doesn't close you connection, simply forget those
	LCP timeouts.


Q:	I get these lines in /var/log/messages:
	ioctl(PPPIOCGFLAGS): Inappropriate ioctl for device
	Connexion failed

A:	Check your kernel config (below).

	Upgrade your eciadsl driver version.

	Try another synch .bin.


Q:	I get some "USB timeout" lines in /var/log/messages.

A:	Try to uncomment the MTU line in /etc/ppp/peers/adsl.


Q:	I get modem hangups but my problems doesn't match the previous questions.

A:	Is your USB chipset an old VIA one? Some are known to be buggy and to have
	problems regarding to USB power supply. If you modem is now OFF (no power),
	this is your case.

	On some systems (bugger USB chipset or old processors), this may happen
	when you use multiple USB device that sucks a lot of power (video devices,
	hdd).

Q:	PPP line sometimes goes down (modem hangup).

A:	This may be due to high traffic on the line or to any provider problem/daily
	disconnection (non-exhaustive list).

	Enable the 'persist' option for pppd in /etc/ppp/peers/adsl (this requires
	N_HDLC support in the kernel, see the kernel configuration related question
	below).

	You may also try using a third-party autoconnect script, and of course check
	if your configuration has been properly set.


Q:	Is this possible to launch startmodem at boot time?

A:	Yes it is, using init.d. Some pre-configured scripts/configurations are
	available, ask us for them of check the cnx package available from the
	download sections at the offcial eciadsl websites.


Q:	I cannot connect in console mode whereas it works fine under X11.

A:	TODO


Q:	I cannot connect under X11 whereas it works fine in console mode.

A:	TODO


Q:	How to properly configure kernel from the sources to get USB/PPP/HDLC support?

A:	Type the following commands:
		cd /usr/src/linux
		make -s menuconfig
			USB support --->
			<M> Support for USB
			[ ]   USB verbose debug messages
			--- Miscellaneous USB options
			[*]   Preliminary USB device filesystem
			[ ]   Enforce USB bandwidth allocation (EXPERIMENTAL)
			[ ]   Long timeout for slow-responding devices (some MGE Ellipse UPSes)
			--- USB Host Controller Drivers
			< >   EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support (EXPERIMENTAL)
			<M>   UHCI (Intel PIIX4, VIA, ...) support
			<M>   UHCI Alternate Driver (JE) support
			<M>   OHCI (Compaq, iMacs, OPTi, SiS, ALi, ...) support
			..
			--- USB Multimedia devices
			..
			< >   DABUSB driver
			..

			Character devices --->
			..
			[*] Non-standard serial port support
			<M>   HDLC line discipline support
			..

			Network device support --->
			..
			<M> PPP (point-to-point protocol) support
			[ ]	PPP multilink support (EXPERIMENTAL)
			<M>	PPP support for async serial ports
			<M>	PPP support for sync tty ports
			<M>	PPP Deflate compression
			<M>	PPP BSD-Compress compression
			< >	PPP over Ethernet (EXPERIMENTAL)
			..
		make -s dep modules modules_install && depmod -a
	or whatever command you use to compile and install the kernal modules.
	Also make -s bzImage if PPP or USB support was previously in kernel instead
	of as modules!
 	You can enable all USB Host Controller Drivers but must use the relevant one
	only!
	DABUSB must be disabled.

	Upgrade your modutils package.

	Then you must see these available modules when you type modeprobe -l:
		usbcore
	and
		usb-uhci or ush-ohci or uhci
	and
		ppp_generic ppp_async ppp_synctty bsd_comp ppp_deflate
	and also
		n_hdlc

	Add these following lines in your /etc/modules.conf if they are missing:
		alias char-major-108 ppp_generic
		alias /dev/ppp ppp_generic
		alias tty-ldisc-3 ppp_async
		alias tty-ldisc-13 n_hdlc
		alias tty-ldisc-14 ppp_synctty
		alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
		alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate
		alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate
		alias char-major-180 usbcore
	and
		alias usb-hostadapter usb-uhci
	or	alias usb-hostadapter usb-ohci
	or	alias usb-hostadapter uhci
	then
		touch /etc/modules.conf /lib/modules/<kernel version>/modules.dep


Q:	I get kernel panic/oops like: TODO

A:	Wait for eciadsl version 0.7 (there's a lack URB clean-up when pppd
	disconnects).
	TODO: other problems.


Q:	I get the message in /var/log/messages:
	kernel: usb-uhci.c: ENXIO 80000880, flags 0, urb c5205d60, burb c2ad1120

A:	TODO


Q:	I'm not from France, will the driver work with my modem and provider?

A:	Verify that your modem is supported. If your modem isn't in the list of
	the supported modem and is NOT in the list of UN-supported modem, ask
	us for further help.

	Think about checking which protocol you windows driver uses. If it's PPPoE
	or other protocol/layers, it may be a problem since current driver version
	may not support them until a further release.

	You may also have problems if your provider doesn't need authentication or
	provide DHCP services or any other exotic stuff.

	Users from Belgium or Italy: get further info or specific patched
	version from here:
		http://www.prout.be/ECI/
		http://www.hctechnews.org/


Q:	I'm not from France, my modem is supported ans startmodem went OK, but I
	get problems with pppd (LCP problems maybe).

A:	Verify that you modem is supported and that the installation and
	configuration went OK.

	Upgrade your eciadsl driver version (0.5 owners: get the latest CVS)

	Try other synch .bin.

	Check above questions.
	
	If you live outside from France, you may also try to set these options:
		-mode VCM_RFC2364
	or	-mode LLC_RFC2364
	or	-mode LLC_SNAP_RFC1483
	to the pppoeci invocation in /etc/ppp/peers/adsl.
	It may worth trying the -alt 4 option too.

	See also the previous question.
