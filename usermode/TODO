Usermode TODO list (pending tasks):

Sorted according to priority (the upper in the list, the prior):

* done
+ currently in development
- pending

0.6:
* merging of pending patches (LCP timeouts, LLC/LLC_SNAP, eci-load* timeout detection, oliverthered*)
* fix: problems with USB 2.0 HUBs (ehci-hdc)
* synch_bin in repository
* ANSIC89 compliance
* eciconftxt.sh
* probe_device.sh
+ add auto modes to probe_device.sh
+? synch bin auto selection (config time only)
+ packaging:
  * ./configure and .sk, changes to config files (get them from cnx, inc. startmodem?) and
    modify scripts
  - fix makeconfig: adsl file seems to be empty sometimes (bug)
  * fix ETC_DIR use (separate installation and syst configuration uses)
  * updates tcl and sh scripts to get configured by ./configure or to use a eciadsl/conf file
  + some more checks in ./configure (see TODO inside, check for GNU install, sed and grep and
    other util stuff..)
  - --with-kernel-sources=<PATH> in ./configure -> pusb-linux.c's linux/* includes
+ unify websites: eciadsl.sf.net update/move to flashtux
- update the spec file
* redesign eciconf.sh UI
* see if selected modem/provider/synchbin can be still coloured when an item from another
  listbox is selected.
- see if synch_bin update function (invert_bin) can use invert_fai's scheme (minor).
* add grep -m check to ./configure, else use egrep (fixed temporarily).
- synch_bin installation (asks or greps to/into makeconfig or startmodem for CONF_DIR)
* use section numbers in TROUBLESHOOTING files
- fix TROUBLESHOOTING file regarding the USB2 warns.
- skeleton is in adsl and makeconfig. moreover, make install performs stuff on the installed
  adsl file, is this relevant in Makefile?
- add PPPoE and IPoATM patches to the tracker. Then merge then to the main sources.


0.7:
- URB cleaning on decnx (prevents kernel oops)
- pppoeci and eci-load* must rehook TERM (if possible) and STOP signal to cleanup thing and exit
-? fix: multiple physical HUBs, select USB device may fail (benoit's lib or usbfs?)
- code clean up & normalization, string protection in scripts
- submit driver to GNU/Linux distro managers


0.x:
- PPPoE implementation (patch from flynux/prout.be)
- 1483b and 1483r implementations? (cannot find RFCs!?)


0.y:
- check and merge bsd 0.5 port
- submit driver to *BSD distro managers


1.0:
- auto*stuff (autoconf/make)
- new USB implementation (benoit)
- ?
