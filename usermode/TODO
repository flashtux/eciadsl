Usermode TODO list (pending tasks):

Sorted according to priority (the upper in the list, the prior):

* done
+ currently in development
- pending
? is this really necessary?

0.6:
* merging of pending patches (LCP timeouts, LLC/LLC_SNAP, eci-load* timeout detection, oliverthered*)
* fix: problems with USB 2.0 HUBs (ehci-hdc)
* synch_bin in repository
* ANSIC89 compliance
* eciconftxt.sh
* probe_device.sh
* synch bin auto selection (config time only)
* packaging:
  * ./configure and .sk, changes to config files (get them from cnx, inc. startmodem?) and
    modify scripts
  * fix makeconfig: adsl file seems to be empty sometimes (bug)
  * fix ETC_DIR use (separate installation and syst configuration uses)
  * updates tcl and sh scripts to get configured by ./configure or to use a eciadsl/conf file
  * some more checks in ./configure (see TODO inside, check for GNU install, sed and grep and
    other util stuff..)
  * --with-kernel-sources=<PATH> in ./configure -> pusb-linux.c's linux/* includes
* unify websites: eciadsl.sf.net update/move to flashtux
* redesign eciconf.sh UI
* see if selected modem/provider/synchbin can be still coloured when an item from another
  listbox is selected.
* add grep -m check to ./configure, else use egrep (fixed temporarily).
+? add auto modes to probe_device.sh
+ redesign probe_synch.sh to reset the modem between each synch .bin test
- update the spec file
- synch_bin installation (asks or greps to/into makeconfig or startmodem for CONF_DIR)
-? see if synch_bin update function (invert_bin in eciconf.sh) can use invert_fai's scheme (minor).
* use section numbers in TROUBLESHOOTING files
* fix TROUBLESHOOTING file regarding the USB2 warns.
* fix EICON problems with 0.6-preX
* add doc about connecting using startmodem at boot
* removed: skeleton is in adsl and makeconfig. moreover, make install performs stuff on the installed
  adsl file, is this relevant in Makefile?
* keep previous settings when installing/configuring (eciconf.sh)
* keep previous settings when installing/configuring (eciconftxt.sh)
* merge oliverthered's pending patches (stability, gs7070), update doc if necessary
* merge flynux's pending extra-AAL5-encaps patch, -mode selection (protocol) using eciconf*, update doc
* remove synch and firm link, all scripts and exec must use eciadsl.conf (startmodem for instance)
* eciload* and pppoeci should read the .conf file by default (see pending patch or merge wwp's previous implementation)
* fix a hole in makeconfig: updated a pre-existing eciadsl.conf does not re-add missing fields
* complete translations, create README files, replace "jump previs/next question" w/ "see x.y" in the TROUBLESHOOTING files
+ add better documentation in the TROUBLESHOOTING/INSTALL files about DHCP/static IP and the PPP mode.
- reimplement the .bak system in makeconfig (yak!)
- eciconf*: allow/disallow username/passwd DHCP or STATICIP following the PPP MODE selected:
  if (VCM_RFC2364 || LLC_RFC2364) -> !DHCP, !staticip, user/pass
  if RFC1483_ETH for both -> (dhcp && if !dhcp -> static ip), !user/pass
  if ROUTED_IP -> !dhcp, !user/pass
  also allow/disallow username+passwd input (routed_ip or dhcp, no need for such info)
* get back password from previous config
* get back DNS IPs from current config if Other is set (and even if Other is not set)
* get back USE_STATICIP from current config


0.7:
- URB cleaning on decnx (prevents kernel oops)
- pppoeci and eci-load* must rehook TERM (if possible) and STOP signal to cleanup thing and exit
-? fix: multiple physical HUBs, select USB device may fail (benoit's lib or usbfs?)
- code clean up & normalization, string protection in scripts
- submit driver to GNU/Linux distro managers


0.x:
- check and merge bsd 0.5 port
- submit driver to *BSD distro managers


1.0:
- auto*stuff (autoconf/make)
- new USB implementation (benoit)
- hotplug/usbmgr integration?
- ?
