EciAdsl - Driver for USB ADSL modems with Globespan chipset
===========================================================

TOTO list - updated on 2004-04-23 by FlashCode <flashcode@flashtux.org>

Sorted according to priority (the upper in the list, the prior):

* done
+ currently in development
- pending
? is this really necessary?


v 0.10:

  + rename all scripts/binaries with "eciadsl-" prefix
  - improve synch .bin detection (eciadsl-probe-synch script)
  - detect if 2.6 USB patch is needed or not
  + hotplug support
  - eciadsl-pppoeci, eciadsl-firmware and eciadsl-synch must rehook TERM
    (if possible) and STOP signal to cleanup thing and exit
  - code clean up & normalization, string protection in scripts
  - submit driver to GNU/Linux distro managers
  - better distro/services(init.d?) integration
  ? use standard ./configure script (autoconf/make tools)
  ? URB cleaning on decnx (prevents kernel oops)
  ? fix: multiple physical HUBs, select USB device may fail (benoit's lib or usbfs?)


Future versions:

  - submit driver to *BSD distro managers
  ? new USB implementation (benoit)
  - change configuration file /etc/eciadsl/eciadsl.conf to a shell parsable
  with VAR="value" and comments only

v 0.6:

  * merging of pending patches (LCP timeouts, LLC/LLC_SNAP, eci-load* timeout detection, oliverthered*)
  * fix: problems with USB 2.0 HUBs (ehci-hdc)
  * synch_bin in repository
  * ANSIC89 compliance
  * eciconftxt.sh
  * probe_device.sh
  * synch bin auto selection (config time only)
  * packaging:
    * ./configure and .sk, changes to config files (get them from cnx, inc. startmodem?) and
      modify scripts
    * fix makeconfig: adsl file seems to be empty sometimes (bug)
    * fix ETC_DIR use (separate installation and syst configuration uses)
    * updates tcl and sh scripts to get configured by ./configure or to use a eciadsl/conf file
    * some more checks in ./configure (see TODO inside, check for GNU install, sed and grep and
      other util stuff..)
    * --with-kernel-sources=<PATH> in ./configure -> pusb-linux.c's linux/* includes
  * unify websites: eciadsl.sf.net update/move to flashtux
  * redesign eciconf.sh UI
  * see if selected modem/provider/synchbin can be still coloured when an item from another
    listbox is selected.
  * add grep -m check to ./configure, else use egrep (fixed temporarily).
  * redesign probe_synch.sh to reset the modem between each synch .bin test
  * update the spec file
  * use section numbers in TROUBLESHOOTING files
  * fix TROUBLESHOOTING file regarding the USB2 warns.
  * fix EICON problems with 0.6-preX
  * add doc about connecting using startmodem at boot
  * removed: skeleton is in adsl and makeconfig. moreover, make install performs stuff on the installed
    adsl file, is this relevant in Makefile?
  * keep previous settings when installing/configuring (eciconf.sh)
  * keep previous settings when installing/configuring (eciconftxt.sh)
  * merge oliverthered's pending patches (stability, gs7070), update doc if necessary
  * merge flynux's pending extra-AAL5-encaps patch, -mode selection (protocol) using eciconf*, update doc
  * remove synch and firm link, all scripts and exec must use eciadsl.conf (startmodem for instance)
  * eciload* and pppoeci should read the .conf file by default (see pending patch or merge wwp's previous implementation)
  * fix a hole in makeconfig: updated a pre-existing eciadsl.conf does not re-add missing fields
  * complete translations, create README files, replace "jump previs/next question" w/ "see x.y" in the TROUBLESHOOTING files
  * add better documentation in the TROUBLESHOOTING/INSTALL files about DHCP/static IP and the PPP mode.
  * get back password from previous config
  * get back DNS IPs from current config if Other is set (and even if Other is not set)
  * get back USE_STATICIP from current config
