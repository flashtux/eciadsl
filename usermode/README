INTRODUCTION
============

EciAdsl is a GNU/Linux driver for Globespan chipset-based ADSL USB modems.
The driver is known to work in many countries, for different kinds of ADSL
USB modems, using different kinds of PPP encapsulation layers modes (see the
supported modems list at http://eciadsl.flashtux.org/modems.php).


PRE-REQUISITES
==============

- a running GNU/Linux system (x86 architecture) with standard tools
  (MDK9/RH8/top-recent/exotic ones may have (solvable) problems, BSD
  and other systems are not officially supported yet)
- USB 1.1 hardware support
- Linux kernel 2.4.x (>=2.4.18-pre3 or <2.4.18-pre3+N_HDLC patch in
  order to get automatic pppd reconnection feature working, which is
  recommanded)
	- USB support (as modules):
		- general USB support
		- USB preliminary fs
		- your HUB USB controller AS MODULE
		- no DABUSB module enabled
	- PPP support (including usermode pppd package >=2.4.0)
- installation from the sources: standard development packages (Linux
  sources in /usr/src/linux, GNU software like gcc>=2.91.66, GNU make, etc.)
- USB modem (*only* GlobeSpan chipset inside)
- bash (>=2.x.x)
- optionally: tcl/tk >= 8.x.x, perl
- root privileges (at least to install the driver)


INSTALLATION FROM THE SOURCES
=============================

Read the INSTALL file.


INSTALLATION FROM A PRE-COMPILED PACKAGE
========================================

Using a .rpm, as root:
	rpm -i <the file>.rpm

You may have to remove previously installed versions of this
package (or to use a flag to ignore the previously installed
one if you are warned to).
Then: read the INSTALL file, installed in /usr/local/doc/eciadsl by default,
starting at the CONFIGURATION section.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you get problems, look at the TROUBLESHOOTING file.


Where to get support:
	Support, packages (driver and optional synch .bin's) and documentation:
		- IRC: openprojects.net, #eci channel
		- http://eciadsl.flashtux.org?lang=en
		  (documentation, forum, user mailing list, etc.)
		  
	We provide support in both French and English languages.


Provide use these info:

	- kernel version (see: `uname -a` or `cat /proc/version`). Tell us if
	  the kernel is your distro's one or if you compiled it from the sources
	- Linux distribution
	- pppd version (see: `pppd --version`)
	- modutils version (see: `lsmod --version`)
	- USB Controller (HUB) model (see: `lspci | grep USB`)
	- eciadsl driver version (see the VERSION file in the sources tarball if it
	  exists for version >0.5, or try pppoeci --version, or the package name/CVS
	  date) and :
		- your MS Windows driver info if you use it (and also the modulation
		  type that your provider supports)
		- the synch .bin you've tried
	- your modem exact brand/model
	- you location (country/state/region/town)
	- your provider and the PPP encapsulation/authentication protocol used
	- your Linux experience level (for instance: newbie, average, confirmed,
	  experienced, guru)
	- the output of route -n before and after running startmodem if a network
	  problem occurs after startmodem
	- your /etc/eciadsl/eciadsl.conf file, and if possible, your
	  /var/log/messages (verify that it contains activity trace since your last
	  boot under Linux up to your use of the driver or your problem).

It may help a lot if you come and see us with these info. Also get the output of
the tools from the package you have launched (configure scripts or startmodem),
also provide us your /var/log/messages, /var/log/log if available, the output
of `dmesg`, `lsmod` and `cat /proc/bus/usb/devices`.

If you contact us from MS Windows, and if your Linux partition (ext2 or ext3 only)
is on the same machine, use explore2fs to get the files directly from your Linux
partition instead of rebooting each time to Linux to get a file!
