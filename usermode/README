INTRODUCTION
============

<TODO>


PRE-REQUISITES
==============

- a running GNU/Linux system (x86 architecture) with standard tools
  (MDK9/RH8/top-recent/exotic ones may have (solvable) problems, BSD
  and other systems are not officially supported yet)
- USB 1.1 hardware support
- Linux kernel 2.4.x (>=2.4.18-pre3 or <2.4.18-pre3+N_HDLC patch in
  order to get automatic pppd reconnection feature working, which is
  recommanded)
	- USB support (as modules):
		- general USB support
		- USB preliminary fs
		- your HUB USB controller AS MODULE
		- no DABUSB module enabled
	- PPP support (including usermode pppd package >=2.4.0)
- standard development packages (Linux sources in /usr/src/linux,
  GNU software like gcc>=2.91.66, GNU make, etc.)
- single hardware HUB?
- USB modem (*only* GlobeSpan chipset inside)
- bash (>=2.x.x)
- optionally: tcl/tk >= 8.x.x
- root privileges


INSTALLATION
============

Read the INSTALL file.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you get problems, look at the TROUBLESHOOTING file.


Where to get support:
	Support, packages (driver and optional synch .bin's) and documentation:
		- IRC: openprojects.net, #eci channel
		- http://eciadsl.sf.net or http://eciadsl.flashtux.org?lang=en
		  (documentation, forum, user mailing list, etc.)
		  
	We provide support in both French and English languages.


Provide use these info:

	- kernel version (see: `uname -a` or `cat /proc/version`). Tell us if
	  the kernel is your distro's one or if you compiled it from the sources
	- Linux distribution
	- pppd version (see: `pppd --version`)
	- modutils version (see: `lsmod --version`)
	- USB Controller (HUB) model (see: `lspci | grep USB`)
	- eciadsl driver version (see the VERSION file if it exists for version >0.5,
	  else the package name or CVS date) and :
		- your Windows driver info if you use it (and also the modulation
		  type that your provider supports)
		- the synch .bin you've tried
	- your modem brand/model
	- you location (country/state/region/town), your provider
	- your Linux experience level (for instance: newbie, average, confirmed,
	  experienced, guru)

It may help a lot if you come and see us with these info. Also get the output of
the tools from the package you have launched (configure scripts or startmodem),
also provide us your /var/log/messages, /var/log/log if available, the output
of `dmesg`, `lsmod` and `cat /proc/bus/usb/devices`.

If you contact us from Windows, and if your Linux partition (ext2 or ext3 only)
is on the same machine, use explore2fs to get the files directly from your Linux
partition instead of rebooting each time to Linux to get a file!
