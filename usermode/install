All you have to do is to run make then make install.
After edit /etc/ppp/peers/adsl file to change user name, vpi and vci 
according to your provider and account.
Then just add a line like 'yourusername * yourpass *' in the /etc/ppp/chap-secrets file (keep all starts).
thats all
you can use startmodem script to start the modem.
