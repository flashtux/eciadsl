# 08/05/2001 Updated. Added "novj" & removed "kdebug 7"
# 07/02/2002 Replace "maxfail 0" by "maxfail 10"
# 29/04/2002 Added the option "linkname" to easily locate the running pppd
#
# This file could be rename but its place is under /etc/ppp/peers
# To connect to Internet using this configuration file, type
# pppd call adsl, where "adsl" stands for the name of this file

# maxfail is the number of times pppd retries to execute pppoeci after
# an error. If you put 0, pppd retries forever, filling up the process table

# If your PPP peer answer to LCP EchoReq (lcp-echo requests), you can
# use the lcp-echo-failure to detect disconnected links with:
#
# lcp-echo-interval 600
# lcp-echo-failure 10
#
# However, if your PPP peer DOES NOT answer to lcp-echo request, you MUST
# desactivate this feature with the folowing line
#
lcp-echo-interval 0

# You may need the following, but ONLY as a workaround
