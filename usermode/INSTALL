If you have installed the driver using a pre-compiled package, jump to the
CONFIGURATION section.


COMPILATION
===========

All you have to do is to run in a console or a terminal
	./configure
then
	make

Check ./configure --help to get a list of optional settings. You may want to
install the software in a different place than the default one (/usr/local),
using --prefix=/opt for instance.

Driver's config files can also be installed in a directory you may prefer
(default is in /etc/eciadsl), using the --conf-prefix (default is /) AND
--conf-fir (default is eci/adsl) parameters. For instance:
	--conf-prefix=/opt --conf-dir=etc/eciadsl
or	--conf-prefix=/opt/eciadsl --conf-dir=etc

Be careful, --etc-prefix can be changed too (defaut is /, so /etc is used),
but it is used to get system config files like resolv.conf or the pppd config
files. Use --etc-prefix only if you know what you are doing.

See other options using ./configure --help.


INSTALLATION
============

Type (as root)
	make install


CONFIGURATION
=============

Still as root:
 - under X11, open a terminal and run eciadsl-config-tk (it requires tcl/tk
   to be installed)
 - in console mode, run eciadsl-config-text

Typing:
	make cfg
will automatically run the relevant configuration tool.

If you encounter problems, try using eciadsl-doctor et please read the
TROUBLESHOOTING file before asking for support online :-)

If you need to manually change the config files, check in /etc/eciadsl
(or /opt/etc/eciadsl if you passed --etc-prefix=/opt to ./configure for
instance). See also /etc/ppp/peers/asdl for pppd settings related to
the installed driver and /etc/ppp/chap-secrets if your ISP expects a
CHAP authentication for instance.


USAGE
=====

Run eciadsl-start as root, from elsewhere but the sources directory.

PPPoE user's:
You have to configure and use a standard PPPoE client as rp-pppoe
(http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe) to connect to your adsl modem
through tap0.


DEINSTALLATION
==============

From within the source tree (in console mode or in a terminal):
	make uninstall
and optionally
	make distclean

From a .rpm:
	rpm -e eciadsl-usermode
