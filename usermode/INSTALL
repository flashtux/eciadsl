If you have installed the driver using a pre-compiled package, jump to the
CONFIGURATION section.


INSTALLATION
============

All steps can be done as a normal user, except the "make install" which needs
to be run as root.

== Installing from CVS ==

To download the source code from CVS and compile it:

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/eciadsl co usermode
  cd usermode
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure
  make
  make install

== Building a tar.gz from CVS ==

To create an eciadsl-usermode-*.tar.gz in the current directory:

  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/eciadsl co usermode
  cd usermode
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure
  make dist

== Installing from a tar.gz ==

To compile the source code from a tar.gz:

  tar zxvf eciadsl-usermode-*.tar.gz
  cd eciadsl-usermode-*
  ./configure
  make
  make install

== Building a rpm package from a tar.gz ==

If you want to build as a normal user, you need to properly configure your
$HOME/.rpmmacros. Here is an example:

  %_topdir %(echo "${HOME}")/rpm

To build a rpm package (RedHat, Mandrake, Fedora, ...) from a tar.gz:

  rpmbuild -ta eciadsl-usermode-*.tar.gz

== Building a debian package from a tar.gz ==

  tar zxvf eciadsl-usermode-*.tar.gz
  cd eciadsl-usermode-*
  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

== General ==

Check ./configure --help to get a list of optional settings. You may want to
install the software in a different place than the default one (/usr/local),
using --prefix=/opt for instance.

Driver's config files can also be installed in a directory you may prefer
(default is in /etc/eciadsl), using the --sysconfdir (default is /etc)
parameters. For instance:

  ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc

Be careful, --sysconfdir can be changed but it is used to get system config
files like resolv.conf or the pppd config files. Use --sysconfdir only if you
know what you are doing.

If you want to know all the availables options:

  ./configure --help.

CONFIGURATION
=============

Still as root:
 - under X11, open a terminal and run eciadsl-config-tk (it requires tcl/tk
   to be installed)
 - in console mode, run eciadsl-config-text

Typing:
	make cfg
will automatically run the relevant configuration tool.

If you encounter problems, try using eciadsl-doctor et please read the
TROUBLESHOOTING file before asking for support online :-)

If you need to manually change the config files, check in /etc/eciadsl
(or /opt/etc/eciadsl if you passed --etc-prefix=/opt to ./configure for
instance). See also /etc/ppp/peers/asdl for pppd settings related to
the installed driver and /etc/ppp/chap-secrets if your ISP expects a
CHAP authentication for instance.


USAGE
=====

Run eciadsl-start as root, from elsewhere but the sources directory.

PPPoE user's:
You have to configure and use a standard PPPoE client as rp-pppoe
(http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe) to connect to your adsl modem
through tap0.


DEINSTALLATION
==============

From within the source tree (in console mode or in a terminal):
	make uninstall
and optionally
	make distclean

From a .rpm:
	rpm -e eciadsl-usermode
