COMPILATION
===========

All you have to do is to run
	./configure
then
	make

Check ./configure --help to get a list of optional settings. You may want to
install the software in a different place than the default one (/usr/local),
using --prefix=/opt for instance.

Driver's config files can also be installed in a directory you may prefer
(default is in /etc/eciadsl), using the --conf-prefix (default is /) AND
--conf-fir (default is eci/adsl) parameters. For instance:
	--conf-prefix=/opt --conf-dir=etc/eciadsl
or	--conf-prefix=/opt/eciadsl --conf-dir=etc

Be careful, --etc-prefix can be changed too (defaut is /, so /etc is used),
but it is used to get system config files like resolv.conf or the pppd config
files. Use --etc-prefix only if you know what you are doing.


INSTALLATION
============

Type (as root)
	make install


CONFIGURATION
=============

Still as root:
 - under X11, open a terminal and run ecicon.sh (it requires tcl/tk
   to be installed)
 - in console mode, run eciconftxt.sh

Typing:
	make cfg
will automatically run the relevant configuration tool.

If you encounter problems, try using eci-doctor.sh et please read the
TROUBLESHOOTING file before asking for support online :-)

If you need to manually change the config files, check in /etc/eciadsl
(or /opt/etc/eciadsl if you passed --etc-prefix=/opt to ./configure for
instance). See also /etc/ppp/peers/asdl for pppd settings related to
the installed driver and /etc/ppp/chap-secrets if your ISP expects a
CHAP authentication for instance.


USE
===

Run startmodem as root.


UNINSTALLATION
==============

From within the source tree:
	make uninstall
and optionally
	make distclean
